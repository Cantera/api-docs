        "\n# Mixing two streams\n\nSince reactors can have multiple inlets and outlets, they can be used to\nimplement mixers, splitters, etc. In this example, air and methane are mixed\nin stoichiometric proportions. Due to the low temperature, no reactions occur.\nNote that the air stream and the methane stream use *different* reaction\nmechanisms, with different numbers of species and reactions. When gas flows\nfrom one reactor or reservoir to another one with a different reaction\nmechanism, species are matched by name. If the upstream reactor contains a\nspecies that is not present in the downstream reaction mechanism, it will be\nignored. In general, reaction mechanisms for downstream reactors should\ncontain all species that might be present in any upstream reactor.\n\nCompare this approach for the transient problem to the method used for the\nsteady-state problem in :doc:`mixing.py <../thermo/mixing>`.\n\nRequires: cantera >= 3.1.0, graphviz\n\n.. tags:: Python, thermodynamics, reactor network, mixture\n"
