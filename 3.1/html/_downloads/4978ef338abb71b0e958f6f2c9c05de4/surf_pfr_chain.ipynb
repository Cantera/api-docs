        "\n# Plug flow reactor modeled as a chain of well stirred reactors\n\nThis example solves a plug flow reactor problem, where the chemistry is surface\nchemistry. The specific problem simulated is the partial oxidation of methane over a\nplatinum catalyst in a packed bed reactor. To avoid needing to solve a DAE system, the\nPFR is approximated as a chain of successive WSRs. See :doc:`surf_pfr.py <surf_pfr>` for\na more advanced implementation that solves the DAE system directly.\n\nRequires: cantera >= 3.0\n\n.. tags:: Python, catalysis, reactor network, surface chemistry, plug flow reactor,\n          packed bed reactor\n"
