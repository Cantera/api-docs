        "\n# Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor\n\nIn this example we will illustrate how Cantera can be used to simulate a\n[continuously stirred tank reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_stirred-tank_reactor)_\n(CSTR), also interchangeably referred to as a perfectly stirred reactor (PSR), a well\nstirred reactor (WSR), a jet stirred reactor (JSR), or a\n[Longwell reactor](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13160/chapter/48)_ (and\nthere may well be more \"aliases\").\n\nRequires: cantera >= 3.0, matplotlib >= 2.0, pandas\n\n.. tags:: Python, combustion, reactor network, well-stirred reactor\n\n## Simulation of a CSTR/PSR/WSR\n\nA diagram of a CSTR is shown below:\n\n<img src=\"file://_static/images/samples/stirred-reactor-solo.svg\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"A continuously stirred tank reactor with inflow and outflow\" align=\"center\">\n\nAs the figure illustrates, this is an open system (unlike a batch reactor, which is\nisolated). *P*, *V* and *T* are the reactor's pressure, volume and temperature\nrespectively. The mass flow rate at which reactants come in is the same as that of the\nproducts which exit, and on average this mass stays in the reactor for a characteristic\ntime $\\tau$, called the *residence time*. This is a key quantity in sizing the\nreactor and is defined as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\\tau = \\frac{m}{\\dot{m}}\\end{align}\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the gas.\n"

        "## Reactor arrangement\n\nWe showed a cartoon of the reactor in the first figure in this notebook, but to\nactually simulate that, we need a few peripherals. A mass-flow controller upstream of\nthe stirred reactor will allow us to flow gases in, and in-turn, a \"reservoir\" which\nsimulates a gas tank is required to supply gases to the mass flow controller.\nDownstream of the reactor, we install a pressure regulator which allows the reactor\npressure to stay within. Downstream of the regulator we will need another reservoir\nwhich acts like a \"sink\" or capture tank to capture all exhaust gases (even our\nsimulations are environmentally friendly!). This arrangement is illustrated below:\n\n<img src=\"file://_static/images/samples/stirred-reactor-network.svg\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"A complete reactor network representing a continuously stirred tank reactor\" align=\"center\">\n\n### Initialize the stirred reactor and connect all peripherals\n\n"
