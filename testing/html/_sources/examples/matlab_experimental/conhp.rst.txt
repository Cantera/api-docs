ODE system for a constant-pressure, adiabatic reactor
=====================================================


Function ``CONHP`` evaluates the system of ordinary differential equations
for an adiabatic, constant-pressure, zero-dimensional reactor.
It assumes that the ``gas`` object represents a reacting ideal gas mixture.

    function dydt = conhp(t, y, gas, mw)
        % Set the state of the gas, based on the current solution vector.
        gas.Y = y(2:end);
        gas.TP = {y(1), gas.P};
        nsp = gas.nSpecies;
