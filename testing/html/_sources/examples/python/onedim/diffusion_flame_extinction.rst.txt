Diffusion flame extinction strain rate
======================================

This example computes the extinction point of a counterflow diffusion flame.
A hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flame at 1 bar is studied.

The tutorial makes use of the scaling rules derived by Fiala and Sattelmayer
(doi:10.1155/2014/484372). Please refer to this publication for a detailed
explanation. Also, please don't forget to cite it if you make use of it.

Requires: cantera >= 3.0, matplotlib >= 2.0

Simulate counterflow flames at increasing strain rates until the flame is
extinguished. To achieve a fast simulation, an initial coarse strain rate
increase is set. This increase is reduced after an extinction event and
the simulation is again started based on the last burning solution.
The extinction point is considered to be reached if the abortion criteria
on strain rate increase and peak temperature decrease are fulfilled.
